# Gate: architectural boundary check on one file.
#
#   boundary-check.sh <file>
#
# Flags import-ish lines that reference a layer this file's own layer is
# forbidden from depending on. Takes a path, returns an exit code — no payload,
# no stdin. See post-edit-gate.sh for the gate/adapter split.
#
# Rules file: .claude/workflow/boundaries.rules
#   layer <name> <dir-prefix>/     (e.g.  layer domain src/domain/)
#   deny <from-layer> -> <to-layer>
#
# belay-debt: grep heuristic, not AST resolution. It matches import/require/use/
# include lines that mention the denied layer's directory name or full prefix.
# Catches the realistic violations (direct path imports). Three kinds slip past,
# and they look nothing alike in a diff: an aliased import (`@/infra/x`), a
# dynamic one, and a barrel re-export — importing from `src/shared/index.ts`,
# which re-exports infra, names infra on no line of the importing file.
# Python has two of its own: `from . import infra` (whether `infra` is the layer or a
# subpackage of the importing one is not decidable from the line) and an import by
# string, `importlib.import_module("infra.db")`. Upgrade path: import-linter, below.
#
# C-family files are read through cpp_lines (hooks/lib/common.sh): continuations are
# joined, `#if 0` regions dropped, same-file `#define`d include names expanded, and
# a C++20 `import infra.x;` counts. An include that reaches a denied layer through a
# header in no layer is not visible from one file; include-check.sh follows it, and
# only scripts/check.sh runs that, since it has to read files other than the one edited.
# Python module paths are dotted, so `.py`/`.pyi` files match the layer's directory
# name as a module's first component, or its full prefix in dotted form (layer_hits).
#
# Do not "upgrade" this script in place. dependency-cruiser (js) and
# import-linter (py) resolve a whole module graph; this gate is handed ONE file
# on every edit, so a resolver belongs in scripts/check.sh as a project-wide
# category alongside tsc and clippy — a toolchain schema change in three places
# (see CLAUDE.md). Until that is worth paying for, mirror the rule in CI.
#
# Exit codes:
#   2  forbidden dependency found; stderr carries the rule and the offending lines.
#   0  everything else — one verdict for two situations a caller cannot tell apart:
#      checked and clean, or no rule reached the file (no boundaries.rules, no path
#      argument, path is not a file, or the file sits under no declared `layer`
#      prefix). The last is the normal state of a fresh install: install.sh writes
#      the rules file fully commented out, so nothing is layered until
#      /bootstrap-project or /adopt-project fills it in. That silence is deliberate —
#      post-edit-gate.sh passes docs and engine assets the same way; out of scope by
#      configuration is not a gap, and a per-file warning would fire on every edit.
#   No other code is produced, and none may be added: edit-gate-adapter.sh and
#   scripts/check.sh treat any non-zero as a violation, so a third code would reach
#   the operator as a layering breach.
