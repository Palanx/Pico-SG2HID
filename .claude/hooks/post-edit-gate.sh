#   post-edit-gate.sh <file>
#
# Takes a path and returns an exit code. It parses no payload and reads no
# stdin: agent surfaces reach it through edit-gate-adapter.sh, while
# scripts/check.sh and the git pre-commit hook call it directly. One gate, many
# callers — the callers adapt to the gate, never the reverse.
#
# Nothing here can prevent a bad edit; by the time an agent surface calls this,
# the write already happened. Exit 2 returns stderr to the caller, which is how
# Claude fixes the file in the same turn. That is the design (P3): wrong output
# is caught cheaply and immediately, not prevented. Project-wide gates (full
# test suite, tsc, clippy) run in scripts/check.sh.
