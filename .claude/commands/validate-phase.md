description: Run a phase's acceptance gates and the closure test; flip status to done only on a clean pass
argument-hint: <phase-id>

# /validate-phase

**Purpose:** the deterministic gate at the end of a phase (P3). Generation may be
wrong; this step is where wrong is caught. Only a clean pass may set `done` — a phase
marked `done` is load-bearing for every phase that depends on it.

**Arguments:** `$1` — the phase id. Required.

**Preconditions:** `docs/phases/$1/spec.md` and `notes.md` exist; PHASES.md status is `in-progress`. Missing notes.md means `/implement-phase` skipped its mandatory final step — go back and write it first; validation validates the record as well as the code.

**Reads:** `docs/phases/$1/spec.md` + `notes.md`, `.claude/workflow/toolchain.json` (via `scripts/check.sh`), `docs/phases/PHASES.md`.
**Writes:** `docs/phases/$1/notes.md` (validation record appended), `docs/phases/PHASES.md` (status → `done` on pass only).

**The phase's file set and diff** — defined once here, used by steps 3, 5 and 6. Default:
the working tree — `git status --porcelain` and `git diff` (run `git add -N` first so files
new in this phase diff as something rather than nothing) — unioned with the files the
spec's Plan names. **If `notes.md` records a `- base: <ref>` line** under Outcome (written
by `/implement-phase --implemented`; the literal `working tree` means the default applies),
use `git diff <ref>..HEAD` and `git diff --name-only <ref>..HEAD` instead, same union.
Never fall back to the Plan alone: the file the Plan never named is exactly what step 6
exists to catch, so a diff that cannot show it turns three gates into no-ops that report
`pass`.

## Steps

1. **Acceptance criteria.** Run every command in the spec's Acceptance criteria section,
   in order, exactly as written. Record each command's pass/fail. They are executable by
   construction (P3) — if one turns out not to be runnable, that is itself a failure:
   fix the criterion in spec.md and note the fix in notes.md.

2. **Project-wide gates.** Run `scripts/check.sh` and record its output and exit code.
   It runs `test`, `lint` and `typecheck` in their project-wide forms — this catches
   breakage *outside* the phase's own files that the per-file edit gate cannot see. Do
   not run those commands yourself: the script is the same one a human and CI call, and
   running them by hand is how the two paths drift apart. For any category the script
   reports as a `workflow gap:`, print that warning verbatim in the report — an unchecked
   category is stated, never silent (P7).

3. **Boundary sweep.** Run `scripts/check.sh --files <every source file in the phase's
   file set>` (the file set is defined above). This is the same gate the edit path runs,
   re-run as a batch in case any edit bypassed it.
   **Corporate mode** (`.claude/workflow/corporate` exists): also verify no belay state
   path appears in `git status --porcelain` — no line matching
   `^\?\? (\.belay/|CLAUDE\.local\.md|docs/(product|adr|phases|index|security|templates)/|docs/(constraints|adoption-report)\.md|scripts/build-index\.sh)`
   (run `git status --porcelain -uall | grep -E '<that regex>'`; empty output = clean).
   A hit at an un-prefixed path means state was written to the old canonical location
   (move it under `.belay/`); a hit on `.belay/` or `CLAUDE.local.md` means the exclude
   block broke (re-run `install.sh --corporate`). Either way the validation FAILS until
   the status is clean of belay paths.

4. **Index freshness.** Run `scripts/build-index.sh --check`; if stale, run
   `scripts/build-index.sh` so the next phase plans against reality.

5. **Independent spec review.** Only once 1–4 are clean — never review code the cheap gates
   already reject. Dispatch ONE subagent with exactly three inputs: `CLAUDE.md`
   (`CLAUDE.local.md` in corporate mode), `docs/phases/$1/spec.md`, and the phase's diff
   restricted to step 3's file set (defined above — that definition is what makes this work
   on code the operator already committed). Nothing else —
   not `notes.md`, not the dependency notes, not your summary. Starve it deliberately: the
   instinct to be helpful destroys the property under test, because a reviewer who knows what
   you meant cannot see that the spec never said it. Ask for two verdicts only:
   - **contradicts** — a hunk conflicts with the spec's Goal, Plan, Acceptance criteria or
     Out of scope; cite spec line + hunk. Implementation failure: this gate FAILS, back to
     `/implement-phase $1` with the finding — the same loop as any gate failure.
   - **undecidable** — it cannot tell from the spec alone whether a hunk is right, and names
     what was missing. Spec failure, not code failure: feed it to step 6.
   Anything else — naming, structure, "I'd have done it differently" — is taste: append it to
   notes.md under `For later phases`, never block on it. The gate stays deterministic (P3)
   because the reviewer may only compare the diff to the spec, never to its own preferences.
   **No subagent available** (Cursor's `.cursor/commands/`, or any client without Task-style
   dispatch): have the operator run the same three-input review in a fresh session and paste
   the verdict, or record `skipped: no subagent` below. Skipping does not block `done`, but
   the closure test is then self-declared again — that is stated, never silent (P7).

6. **Closure test (P5).** Check the record, not just the code:
   - notes.md has all four sections (Outcome, Deviations, Debt, For later phases), none blank — `None` is an entry, blank is a violation.
   - Every file in the phase's file set is reachable from the spec's Context pointers or Plan. A file changed but never named in the spec = the phase escaped its scope: closure test FAILED. Record it in notes.md Deviations, flag it in your report, and name it in the spec's Plan before re-running — the spec has to describe the change that actually happened.
   - An `undecidable` finding from step 5 IS a missing pointer, found from outside your own head: closure test FAILED; record what the reviewer could not resolve in notes.md Deviations.
   - If notes.md Deviations reports missing pointers, mark the closure test FAILED even if the code passes — the *next* phase pays for it; the operator must know the cuts are drifting.

## Mandatory final step (P6)

Append to `docs/phases/$1/notes.md`:

```
## Validation — <date>
- criteria: <n> passed / <n> failed
- project gates: test <pass|fail|gap>, lint <...>, typecheck <...>
- boundary sweep: <clean|violations listed above>
- independent review: <clean | contradicts: <what> | undecidable: <what was missing> | skipped: no subagent>
- closure test: <pass|fail: reason>
- verdict: <done | returned to implementation>
```

On full pass: PHASES.md status → `done`. On any failure: status stays `in-progress`;
report exactly which gate failed with its output — that error text is the input for the
next iteration. Where that iteration happens depends on what failed: steps 1–4 and a
`contradicts` verdict go back to `/implement-phase $1` (the code is wrong); a closure-test
failure or an `undecidable` verdict is fixed in `spec.md` plus a notes.md Deviations entry
and re-validated from here (the record is wrong). Say which of the two you are handing
back, or the next session guesses.

## Failure modes

- **Gate failure** → not an exception, the designed loop: hand the failing command + output to `/implement-phase $1`, which fixes and returns here. Expected convergence is 1–2 iterations because failures are machine-detectable (P3); if you're on iteration 3+, the spec is wrong — stop and say so, and route it: a wrong *spec* is re-expanded (status back to `pending`, `/expand-phase $1`), a wrong *cut* is re-planned (`/plan-feature`, which supersedes the row). Iterating a fourth time against a spec nobody believes is the failure this escape exists to stop.
- **The code was written by a human** (`/implement-phase --implemented`) → nothing here changes: every gate above judges the code and the record, not the author. If anything the independent review is *stronger*, because the reviewer cannot be told what the human meant — but it is also the first gate this code meets at all, since the edit-time hooks only see edits made through the agent. Read step 2's and step 3's output as new information, not as a re-check.
- **Review verdicts split by consequence** — `contradicts` is a code bug (the loop above); `undecidable` is a spec bug, so the fix is a pointer in spec.md (with the Deviations entry that any spec amendment requires), never a code change to satisfy the reviewer.
- **Everything passes but the closure test** → still a failure: status stays `in-progress`. The code may well be right; the *record* isn't, and the next phase is what pays for that. It is also the cheapest failure here to clear, so clear it rather than arguing with it: name the stray file in the spec's Plan, or add the pointer the reviewer could not resolve, then write the Deviations entry that any spec amendment requires and re-run. A phase marked `done` asserts that a cold session can rebuild its context from the spec — that is exactly what the closure test measures, so `done` on a failed closure test would make the word mean nothing.

## Handoff

Pass → `/expand-phase <next>` (the next pending phase whose dependencies are all done).
Fail → `/implement-phase $1` with this validation report.
